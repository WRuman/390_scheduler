# Scheduling algorithm comparison: CS 390 - Operating Systems
A simulator for several algorithms which are used by operating system CPU schedulers. Includes simulations of FCFS, SRTF, and Round-robin.

## Building and Running
Make sure you are using an environment with a recent version of GCC installed.

1. Enter the project directory
2. Run `make` 
3. Run the program with `./schedule <input filename>`. You can use the included `in.txt` file as an example

## Input file format
The program expects an input file in plaintext with the following format:

+ One process definition per line
+ Two integers per process definition line, separated by a space
+ The first integer is the processes' arrival time (in terms of "ticks")
+ The second integer is the amount of CPU time the process needs (also in terms of "ticks")
 
You can see an example of acceptable formatting in the file `in.txt` within the project root.
